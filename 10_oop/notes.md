//// when we use new keyword an empty object is created
// A protoype is linked :the new keyword inititates the creating of a new Javascript Object.

//the constructor is called:The constructor function is called with the specified arguments and this is bound to the newly created object .If no explicit return value is specified from the constructor , Javascript assumes this,newly created object ,to the intended return value
//The new object is returned :After the constructor function has been called if it doesn't return a non - primitive value 
(object,array function ,etc.),the newly created object is returned .
